# SRAM-based-Programmable-Counter
This project involves designing an 8-bit counter with programmable sequences using the DE2-115 board's SRAM. The counter operates on a one Hz clock signal, reading values from memory and advancing through them accordingly. It features byte selection for read/write operations and abides by addressing constraints within the available memory space.
